How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Observing and conducting interviews with existing or potential product consumers is a crucial aspect to get data needed for users stories. An informal, broad description of a software feature written from the viewpoint of the end user is called a user narrative. Its goal is to clearly state how a software feature will benefit the user. It's easy to assume that user stories are just requirements for software systems.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Continuous integration and continuous development is a two fundamental tenets of agile development. This should be the approach used when creating programs. Agile development practices should encompass story pointing, user story generation, sprint length identification, and if the team is sizable enough.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member is one that is flexible and adaptable. To create high-quality products, team members should collaborate closely. Members of the Scrum Team value each other as competent, self-sufficient individuals.
